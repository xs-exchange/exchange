# XS Exchange
Get access to what you need, by giving what you have in excess.

## What is XS Exchange?

It is a gateway application to a new sustainable economy. This new economy is  built up from basic resources, such as energy and time. These can be freely exchanged, or bundled together to create higher-order products or services. 

## What does XS stand for?

You can read it as “access” and “excess” depending on whether you are using the exchange to get access to something you don’t have, or getting rid of something you have in excess (eg: your time and knowledge, some tomatoes, or your apartment for a weekend)

## What’s different from a normal exchange?

XS allows to exchange resources or services rooted into physical values, rather than assets with a value defined just by demand and offer. 
As exchanges are proposed, built up from the basic resources, a Resource-Based Pricing can be computed automatically by traveling the resource graph (resource ecology) all the way down to basic resources.

## What is the expected impact?

A resource-based exchange represents a world-wide cooperative endeavour to sustainably produce goods and services . No need for different firms  (eg: airbnb, uber, upwork, or other monolithic services) extracting value from peer-to-peer exchanges. No need for product-based ICOs. Just a prosumer-governed open exchange for everything, with the following advantages:

Full transparency: Anyone will be able to see how anything is made, where, and how many resources it took (the “True Price”). No more price inflation due to information asymmetry.

Embedded Sustainability: By using resource based pricing, economising on price directly implies using less resources. By simply following cheaper prices, people would automatically incentivize sustainable development. This is a far cry from the current economic system!

Full inclusion: Since the value chain is completely transparent,  anyone will be able to gain exchangeable assets by contributing to any of its parts. You can either spend time where most contribution is needed, or propose a different exchange to be included. If it is cheaper in terms of resource used, it will be picked up!
